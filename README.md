**Autonomous Treause Hunter Game With JavaFX**

*Alert*
Before starting the project, make sure you have installed JavaFx.

The aim of the game is to design an algorithm that will enable 
an autonomous character to collect all the treasure chests in 
the shortest time by overcoming various obstacles on a randomly 
generated map, and to represent this algorithm with graphical 
units. Within the scope of this project, Java was used as the 
programming language. The software to be developed aims to 
improve logical thinking abilities and algorithmic approaches 
to enable the character to collect all the treasures in the 
shortest way without getting stuck in obstacles.
